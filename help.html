        Dear user,
        <br><br>below you will find a list of screenshots taken from the ProteoSign website, accompanied with a brief description. In some cases, additional helpful information can be found inside the corresponding page. For more details please refer to the article.

            <dt><h3>Welcome page</h3>
              Basic description of the platform. Clicking the <i>Start</i> button takes the user to the next page.

            <dt><h3>Software input definition page</h3>
              The first step of any data analysis: defining the input data set. The input can either be uploaded via the <i>Upload file(s)</i> button or, just for demonstration purposes, be selected from pre-uploaded files by clicking the <i>choose</i> hyperlink.
              <br><br>
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">Data file format:</span>
              <br>ProteoSign accepts Proteome Discoverer or MaxQuant output data. For the case of MaxQuant, one has to simply upload the automatically generated <i>proteinGroups</i> and <i>evidence</i> output files. For the case of Proteome Discoverer, the output required is a single file, but it is not automatically generated and thus has to be generated by the user. This process is described inside a pop-up dialog which shows up when the user hovers the mouse over the blue-colored question mark. For the sake of completeness, the content of that dialog, i.e. the description of the procedure, is shown below.

            <dt><h3>Proteome Discoverer output file generation</h3>
              The <em>peptide spectrum match</em> (PSM) file, comprising the necessary information required for protein quantitation, has to be produced manually through the PD desktop application (see the <em>Export&#x2192;To Text</em> option under the <em>File</em> menu).</p><p>The PSM file must be created from within a PD report which combines the information from all relevant MS analyses (i.e. replicates, conditions etc). Such a PD report is sometimes required to be created based on separate reports and is referred to as a multi-consensus report.</p><p>Before exporting the information, one <strong>must</strong> firstly disable peptide grouping (see relevant screen in Figure 1 on the right) and secondly edit the report's <em>Quantification Method</em> by configuring the <em>Ratio&nbsp;Calculation</em> parameters as shown in the relevant screen in Figure 2 on the right.</p>

            <dt><h3>Pre-defined input dialog</h3>
              By clicking the aforementioned hyperlink <i>choose</i>, a dialog shows up, listing the available demo data sets. The user can select a data set and click <i>OK</i>, as well as, for inspection purposes, download it by clicking <i>Download</i>.
            </dt>
            <dd><img src="images/scrshot3_help.PNG"/></dd>
            <dt><h3>Software input definition page (continued)</h3>
              Once the input is defined, the software performs a pre-processing step, where the data set is validated. If no error occurs, the user is taken to the next page (see below).
            </dt>
            <dd><img src="images/scrshot3_1_help.PNG"/></dd>
            <dt><h3>Experimental design definition page</h3>
              Here the user must define the experimental structure, i.e. which measurements belong to a certain biological or technical replicate. In a biological treatments-multiplexed proteomics experiment, the measurements/data for each biological or technical replicate, or chromatographic fraction, are contained in single <i>raw</i> file.
              <br><br>
              The table in this page lists the raw files generated in the experiment and the user must <i>assign</i> here the replicate information for every single one of them. In the figure on the right this assignment is automatically performed by the software since a demo data set was selected for analysis.
            </dt>
            <dd><img src="images/scrshot4_help.PNG"/></dd>
            <dt><h3>Experimental design definition page (continued)</h3>
              In the case of user-uploaded data (and not demo data), the figure on the right illustrates the replicate assignment procedure: the user first selects the table rows (i.e. raw files) and then types in the <i>Experimental structure coordinate</i> panel the corresponding biological and/or technical replicate.
              <br><br>
              Usage note: When multiple raw files are selected, if just the biological replicate is entered, the software will assume that the selected raw files are technical replicates of the entered biological replicate. If both the biological and technical replicates are entered, the software will assume that the selected raw files are fractions of the entered technical replicate.
            </dt>
			<dd><img src="images/scrshot5_help.PNG"/></dd>
			<dt><h3>Experimental design definition page (continued): Label-free experiments</h3>
              In the case of label-free data, the figures on the right illustrate the condition assignment procedure: the user first selects the table rows (i.e. raw files) and by right-click, selects <i>Assign Condition</i> from the popup menu, after which he is asked to either define new condition or choose one defined previously.
            </dt>

              Here the user can enter some meta information regarding the experiment (<i>Experiment ID</i> and <i>Experiment description</i>) but most importantly choose the set of biological conditions/treatments to compare against each other. Typically all conditions are selected here via the <i>Conditions to compare</i> list. The <i>advanced parameters</i> section comprises options for filtering-out certain kinds of measurements. More details can be found by hovering the mouse over the question mark icon (at the actual page).
              <br><br>
              By clicking <i>Submit</i> the user initiates the statistical analysis.

		<dd><img src="images/scrshot6_help.PNG"/></dd>
            <dt><h3>Advanced Options</h3>
              In case more than one labels was used for the same condition (common in TMT experiments) the user can mark these labels and select <i>Same Condition</i> as illustrated on the picture by right-click. Afterwards, the user is asked to name the respective condition (e.g. Lung_ADC). The conditions that were labelled by more than one labels are always displayed in <strong>bold</strong>. In order to revert such a condition back to its original labels select <i>Restore Conditions</i>.

              In the case of experiments where <i>label swap</i> is utilized,  the user should declare the swap by pressing <i>Label swap options...</i> as shown on the figure. Then, from within the popup window titled <i>Label Swap Assignment</i>, the user should specify the biological and technical replicates involved as well as the labels swapped and press the <i>Add</i> button. The list on the top-right shows the relevant raw files and the list at the bottom the declared label swaps.
